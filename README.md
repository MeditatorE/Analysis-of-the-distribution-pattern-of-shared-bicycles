## 3. Data analysis
### 3.1 Analysis of rental quantity
We analyzed the total rental data over the past four years and found that the data has seasonal cyclical changes and has been increasing over the past four years, so we Gaussian smoothed the data to calculate the growth rate. Finally, we found that the **annual growth rate was 12.5%**, which means that our first distribution strategy is that the total number of bicycles put into use should increase by 12.5% ​​each year.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/total.png)
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/total_gaussian.png)


We then use heat maps to represent the periodic changes in the number of bicycle rentals over the course of a year and day. We aggregate rental records that fall within the same half-hour interval each month. It can be seen that during the year, the rental volume reaches the peak in summer and the trough in winter, **further indicating that the rental volume is greatly affected by the season**; in the daily cycle, the rental volume increases significantly during the morning peak and evening peak hours. Especially the evening peak is the most obvious peak period.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/heatmap_rental_quantities.png)


### 3.2 Analyze the impact of weather on rental quantity
As can be seen from the bar chart, snowy days have the greatest impact on bicycle rental volume, which is only 28% of the average value. The second is windy days, with rental volume of 56% of the average value. In addition, cloudy and rainy days also have lower rental volume than the average, while sunny and cloudy days have higher rental volume than the average.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/weather_avg.png)
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/8d43c3ce-263c-4713-83ce-6b617b9e48ab.png)

We also visualized the weather for each day and the number of rentals for that day.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/weather_rent_num.png)


#### 3.2.1 Quantifying the impact of weather on rental numbers
To quantify the impact of weather on rental volume, we use significance analysis to evaluate the impact
```
# One-way ANOVA
f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(category_partially_cloudy, category_rain, category_clear_day, category_cloudy, category_snow, category_wind)
print(f"F-statistic: {f_stat:.3f}, P-value: {p_value:.3f}")

# Interpretation of results
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Differences between categories are statistically significant (reject the null hypothesis)")
else:
    print("The difference between different categories is not significant (the null hypothesis cannot be rejected)")
```
```
F-statistic: 26.840, P-value: 0.000
Differences between categories are statistically significant (reject the null hypothesis)
```
**The conclusion is that weather has an impact on travel, and the F-statistic is 26, which means that the variance between groups is 26 times the variance within the group. This shows that the impact of weather on travel is relatively significant.**

In addition, we also counted the impact of different weather conditions on travel. The significance of the impact of different weather conditions on rental volume is as follows:
```
partially_cloudy    F-statistic: 0.560, P-value: 0.454
rain                F-statistic: 4.024, P-value: 0.045
cloudy              F-statistic: 10.340, P-value: 0.002
snow                F-statistic: 87.119, P-value: 0.000
wind                F-statistic: 2.299, P-value: 0.134
```


#### 3.2.2 Quantifying the importance of the impact of different weather features on leasing volumes
Now we know that the daily bicycle rental volume is affected by season (3.1 Conclusion) and weather (3.2 Conclusion), and we have weather data for each of the past four years. There are 24 features in total, namely
```
features = [
"tempmax", "tempmin", "temp", "feelslikemax", "feelslikemin", "feelslike",
"dew", "humidity", "precip", "precipprob", "precipcover", "preciptype",
"snow", "snowdepth", "windgust", "windspeed", "winddir", "sealevelpressure",
"cloudcover", "visibility", "solarradiation", "solarenergy", "uvindex",
"severerisk" ]
```


We need to evaluate the impact index of each feature on the weather. We use importance evaluation to quantify this indicator and use the **XGBoost** model to evaluate the importance of different features. The results are:
```
Feature: tempmax, Importance: 0.03388049080967903
Feature: tempmin, Importance: 0.012917473912239075
Feature: temp, Importance: 0.04539528116583824
Feature: feelslikemax, Importance: 0.006318486295640469

```

The error of this model is:
```
MSE: 4627447.087644517
RMSE: 2151.1501778454513
```
This result shows that **the fit of our model can reach 84.3%**, the MAE is 1458, and the average rental volume for all days is 10156, so the **accuracy of our model can exceed 85%**.

### 3.3 Forecasting future rental volumes
After getting the importance of each feature, we try to use seasonal and weather data to predict future bicycle usage. Here we use the **Prophet** model

**Why use Prophet model?**
The Prophet model is a time series forecasting model designed for processing data with obvious seasonal components and trend changes. Our data is a seasonal periodic change data, which is very suitable for this model.

We then add each important weather feature as a regression variable for Prophet training. The training results are:
```
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3907222.9902083008
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1458.3266245041264
R² Score: 0.8432569983242107
```
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/Prophet_result.png)


### 3.4 The optimal bicycle distribution problem
We can already predict the daily bicycle usage based on the weather (this data can be known in advance because there is a weather forecast), so how do we allocate bicycles? (Optimal distribution problem)

We group the data by month and calculate the total rental volume for this month, and then calculate the proportion of each site to the total rental volume. The results are as follows (Since the amount of data is too huge, we choose the first 100 stations for display)
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/Percentage%20of%20rentals.png)

#### 3.4.1 Optimal Distribution Strategy
**Then, based on our predicted data and the rental volume share of each station each month, we can calculate the recommended number of bicycles to be deployed at any station on any given day, that is, the optimal distribution strategy.**

### 3.5 The best scheduling strategy for each month
#### 3.5.1 Why not schedule by day?
According to the following heat map, the peak hours of each station are in the same time period (morning peak, evening peak), so there is no need to schedule between different stations within a day.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/new_heatmap_station_time.png)

The number changes for each site vary from month to month. **For example, in the heat map below, the number of leases for the sites in the red box in the heat map below was less than that of the sites in the blue box in January and February; however, it increased significantly in March and beyond, exceeding the number of sites in the blue box.** This illustrates the need to schedule between different sites each month.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/heatmap_station_time_marked.png)

#### 3.5.2 Optimal Scheduling Strategy
We also calculated the proportion of returns to the total number of returns at each station (theoretically, the total number of returns should be equal to the total number of rentals), and then **subtracted the proportion of rentals to the total number of rentals at each station from the proportion of returns to the total number of returns at each station to find out whether the number of bicycles at each station is increasing or decreasing each month.** The figure below shows the data for the top 100 stations.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/Difference.png)
In the figure, the blue part means that the number of bicycles at this station is decreasing, the red part means that the number of bicycles is increasing, and the white part means that there is no change. **According to this figure, if the data in a blue grid is 0.1%, it means that the number of bicycles at this station has decreased by 0.1% of the amount put in this month.**

We show the flow of bicycles in and out of each station on the map. **It can be seen that the stations with bicycle inflow are concentrated in the urban area, while the stations with bicycle outflow are concentrated in the suburbs (such as Columbia Heights, Woodley Park).** 

We have provided an interactive map for this section. Please download [washington_map_in_out.html](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/html/washington_map_in_out.html) and open it in your browser.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/washington_map_in_out.png)

#### 3.5.3 Conclusion
**So we get the best scheduling strategy: before the beginning of each month, the bicycles in the red station should be transferred to the blue station according to the predicted increase/decrease percentage of the month.**

### 3.6 Member/Non-member analysis
#### 3.6.1 Membership ratio analysis
In our data, each rental record also includes whether the user is a member. We analyze the behavioral differences between members and non-members to better help bicycle rental companies formulate marketing strategies, such as tapping into potential member users, optimizing member benefits, and personalized push messages.

Among all rental records, **60% are used by members and 40% are non-members.** Although members account for the majority, there are still a considerable number of non-members. **Our goal is to analyze the behavior patterns of members and find as many users as possible who are likely to become members among non-members.** Companies can push more discounts to these people to attract them to become members in order to gain greater profits.
![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/member_barchart.png)

#### 3.6.2 User behavior analysis
We made statistics on the riding time of each record and drew a histogram. Most rides are under 20 minutes. There are significantly more members than non-members who ride for less than 30 minutes; and more non-members for more than 30 minutes.

![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/Ride_duration_marked.png)

**Conclusion:** 

**It can be speculated that when users need to ride a lot of short distances (such as commuting to get off work every day), they are more inclined to join the membership. Users who occasionally go on long rides may not choose to become a member.**

**But there is still a large number of short-distance cyclists who are not members. For non-member users who often ride short distances, they should be attracted to become members. For example, advertisements can be placed at morning and evening peak hours at office area sites. Although the proportion is small, there are still a certain number of long-distance cyclists. Different strategies can be used, such as "you can enjoy discounts on membership fees if you ride for more than one hour" to attract users to gradually convert from a long-distance ride to a member.**

#### 3.6.3 Analysis of the number of members at different stations
This graph shows the number of members and non-members by starting site (sorted by the number of members in descending order, taking the top 100 sites). As you can see from the graph, most sites have more members. But there are also some sites that have more non-members.

![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/member_station.png)

We further counted the stations with more non-member riders, accounting for **37.03%** of all stations
```
Percentage of such stations among all stations: 37.03%
```

On this map, we can see more intuitively that most of the sites have more members (orange), while a few sites with more non-members (blue) are concentrated around famous attractions in Washington DC, such as the Lincoln Memorial, which has the largest number of non-members. **It can be inferred that these non-members may include a large number of tourists from other places.**

We have provided an interactive map for this section. Please download [washington_map_member.html](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/html/washington_map_member.html) and open it in your browser.

![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/washington_map_member.png)

**Conclusion:** 

**For users who often ride at stations with a large number of members, targeted advertising can be placed to attract them to join. For stations near tourist attractions where the majority of users are non-members, other plans can be adopted, such as short-term membership plans and recommended routes to tourist attractions.**

#### 3.6.4 Summary
**In summary, through the analysis of member and non-member behaviors, car rental companies can target potential member users from different angles such as riding time and riding stations to gain more profits and visibility.**

### 3.7 Station Category Analysis
We also artificially divided the stations into three categories: work, entertainment, and life based on the facilities around the stations. The plan is to find out the possible influencing factors of the station type stack usage. The bar chart below shows that the usage of the three types of stations is not much different, among which work is the most, and life is slightly lower than the other two. **It can be seen that the number of the three types of stations is not much different.**

![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/Station_Type_rent.png

Draw three types of stations on the map:

We have provided an interactive map for this section. Please download [washington_map_type.html](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/html/washington_map_type.html) and open it in your browser.

![](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Analysis-of-the-distribution-pattern-of-shared-bicycles/blob/main/result_picture/washington_map_type.png)

**Conclusion:** 

**From this figure, we can see that the station type has little effect on the number of car rentals. It is not necessary to use the station category as a feature to predict the number of car rentals.**

## 4. Conclusion
This project has fully analyzed the existing data and achieved prediction of future rental volume by training the Prophe model with an accuracy of over 85%. Combined with our other analyses, we have given the corresponding **optimal distribution strategy** (**3.4.1**), **optimal scheduling strategy** (**3.5.3**), and **push strategy for non-member users** (**3.6.2 & 3.6.3 & 3.6.4**).
